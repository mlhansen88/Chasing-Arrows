**The Goal:** 

Redesign A Broken Plastic Recycling and Consumer Waste System

**Website:**

**Background:**

  In 1970, in response to a design competition hosted by the Container Corporation of America, a 23 year-old college student submitted a winning sketch that would change consumer decision making forever. On that day the world would be introduced to the “chasing arrows” insignia - a symbol applied to products to identify the type of plastic used in making that product.
  Only 9% of recyclable plastic is recycled properly, and the rest is burned, sent to landfill, or ends up in the ocean. Today there is an estimated 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean, not to mention a gyre the size of Texas. The system is broken and we deserve a new one.
  
**Design Principles:**

In starting the project, we identified 3 design principles that are missing from the old system but are required for success. First, the ability to give people feedback on the performance of their personal recycling effort. Second, the ability for people to trace the impact of their plastic recycling through all stages of the system. Finally, by helping people to create new, usable products from the plastic found throughout their daily lives.

**The Plan:**

 - Sub-Project 1: Create a new embedded controller system for plastic recycling and manufacturing equipment that allows for data collection, analytics, and remote device monitoring / control. Learn more here: https://github.com/mlhansen88/Chasing-Arrows/blob/main/Embedded-IOT-Controller/README.md 
 - Sub-Project 2: Develop a system in the manufactured plastic products to provide supply chain provenance, unique customer experiences, and decentrailized authenitcation/transations.

- More Coming Soon!
