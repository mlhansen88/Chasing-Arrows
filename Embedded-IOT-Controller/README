Project Abstract:
  The goal of this project is to create a new embedded controller system for plastic recycling and manufacturing
  equipment. 

  The current system can be view on the injection machine located here:
  https://minufacture.com/collections/plastic/products/injection-machine

  The current plastic electrical system contains two MYPIN TA temperature controllers that use PID and PWM to drive
  SSRs connected to heating elements monitored by K thermocouples. The system also has a time-controlled relay (not
  shown) that is used drive and hold a pneumatic piston for a set time duration.

  The new embedded controller system should replace the two MYPINS and the time-controlled relay with a single
  embedded microcontroller system (e.g. Beagle Bone Black, Raspberry Pi). The system should work stand alone and
  connect to WifI. This includes a user interface that replicates the ability to set temperatures/times, view current state,
  and operate the device. When connected to the internet, the embedded controller should act as an IOT endpoint with
  connections to the cloud via services like AWS IOT core. Messaging services, like MQTT, to the cloud will allow for data
  collection, future data analytics, and remote device monitoring /control.
